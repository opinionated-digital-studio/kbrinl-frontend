# KBRINL Frontend

KBRINL Frontend is a repository of CSS styles and complementary JavaScript
modules that help build web services for the Embassy of the Republic of
Indonesia in The Hague, The Netherlands.

It is a fork from [GOV.UK
Frontend](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/#gov-uk-frontend) but
heavily stripped to ease maintenance and further development for a tiny team.
With the fork it is the intention to somewhat leverage the extensive research
and testing done on the field of accessability and usability by the UK
Government Digital Service.
